## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, NPM , installed in your environement.

### Node

- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
  Also, be sure to have git available in your PATH, npm might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).
  
  If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v16.14.2

    $ npm --version
    8.5.0

    newer versions should work as well

 ## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/PavleMarkovicStudy/JavaAndWebDevelopmentProject.git
    $ cd JavaAndWebDevelopmentProject
    $ npm install

 ## Running the project

    $ ng serve
